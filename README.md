> Stack concepts - DSA in python

  Hiiüëã, this is Suriyakanth and here i have attached the .py file which describes one of the important concept in DSA(Data Structures & Algorithms), which is **STACK** Concepts.
## What is STACK:
  Basically, Stack follows **LIFO** method, which means **Last In First Out**. Simply, our last input is the first one to gets out. Imagine, you have `4` list values `1,2,3,4` and stored it respectively.
  If u want to access the value `2`, u need to first remove `4`, then remove `3`, then only u can access `2`. This is stack Concept.
  There are 5 basic operations in Stack, which is,
  
- **push** - *add value into the stack*
- **pop** - *remove value into the stack*
- **peek** - *defines top most value in the stack*
- **isEmpty** - *we cannot pop id stack is empty*
- **full** - *we cannot push if stack is full*
These are the five basic operations i include in stack.py file. You can directly run this code on your machine. No libraries needed.

Hope, it will be helpful for you.

*Thank you*‚ù§Ô∏è
